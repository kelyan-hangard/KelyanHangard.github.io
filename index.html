				<h2>Data Analytiks, My Data Science Startup</h2>
				<p>I founded Data Analytiks in September 2022 and have been working part-time at this company since
					then. Mainly working in Python, I have utilized machine learning techniques on call-center data to
					predict call outcomes,
					resulting in a 20% improvement in caller efficiency. Additionally, I have implemented Natural
					Language Processing (NLP) techniques with 90% accuracy to automate and correct caller data filling
					processes. Conducting Sentiment Analysis, I have also worked on enhancing sales speech strategies.
					Currently, I am collaborating with an investment group on the development of additional products.
					Data Analytiks represents my most ambitious project to date. I have successfully collaborated with
					various
					companies across three different countries: Spain, France, and the UK. Data Analytiks has made a
					promising start,
					achieving a margin of approximately 20,000 Swiss Francs within its first year. I will continue to
					actively contribute to
					the development of Data Analytiks until the beginning of my master's thesis, marking the end of this
					interesting experience.

				<h2>Analysis of non-linear air pollution in Python and R</h2>
				<p>Conducted an impactful analysis of non-linear air pollution as part of a project for the
					<a href="https://datascience.ch/">Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC)</a>.
					Utilized Python and R to perform a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
					and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
					across Europe. Uncovered key patterns and structures, identified spatial and temporal correlations,
					and provided insights into pollutant
					distribution and atmospheric lifetimes. Findings can contribute to the development of prediction
					models, environmental policy planning,
					and public health strategies, with potential to improve air quality management across Europe and

				<h2>Science vs Art: Defying the Brain's Divisions in Python</h2>
				<p>This project aims to challenge the stereotype that artistic and scientific people are inherently
					different and not interested in each other's subjects. We analyzed the YouNiverse
					dataset (huge Youtube dataset), which includes 8.6 billion comments and 72 million video metadata
					files, to determine if users who engage with artistic
					videos also engage with scientific videos, and vice versa. We also intend to divide artistic and
					scientific
					videos into smaller domains to examine whether this pattern is influenced by the specific domain of
					art or
					science that the user is interested in. By studying user profiles and our watching/commenting
					behaviors on videos
					that do not typically align with our profiles, we seek to draw conclusions about people's interests.

				<h2>Machine Learning and Deep Learning Time Serie Forecasting in Python and Matlab</h2>
				<p>In this project hosted by the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/desl-pwrs/">Distributed Electrical
						Systems Laboratory (DESL)</a>, two forecasting models with
					different time windows were developed. They predict
					the electricity consumption of an EPFL building (CM)
					with photovoltaic panels given previous data on the building’s
					electrical consumption and meteorological data (irradiance
					and temperature). The pre-processing steps taken with
					the data, including handling of missing data, the feature
					engineering process used to generate additional relevant
					features, the various models designed using different ML
					approaches and their results are all detailed in the report. The final
					models chosen, artificial neural networks with hypertuned
					parameters, achieve 62.09% accuracy for next-day forecasting
					and 62.96% accuracy for intra-day forecasting. These results had
					been judged excellent by the DESL of EPFL.

				<h2>Deep Learning Classification in Python</h2>
				<p>This project focuses on using transfer learning methods to solve an image
					classification problem. In particular, we use the ResNet34 and ResNet18 ConvNets
					to classify the images found in the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset. We also explore the
					effects of different parameters such as number of epochs and learning rates, as well
					as seeing how data augmentation and freezing some layers affects our results. We
					discovered that with transfer learning, it was possible to classify the image as a cat
					or a dog with an accuracy greater than 99%. Furthermore, we also managed to get
					an accuracy of more than 95% when trying to classify the breed of cats and dogs.</p>

					utilizes object-oriented programming principles and incorporates modules, separation of concerns,
					and encapsulation. It employs geometric and graph abstractions to ensure proper distribution of
					neighborhoods and connections, and to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan. The program allows for
					file reading, saving, writing, interactive editing of nodes and links, and features a graphical user
					interface (GUI).
					The project
					showcases object-oriented programming skills in C++ and tackles complex constraints related to
					neighborhood
					representation and pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm.</p>

				<h2>Development of Laser Scanner Module for SileX System in Fusion 360 and Matlab

				<p>I actively participated in a microengineering project where I played a crucial role in developing a

					scanner module for the SileX system. The project aimed to create a laser micro-machining machine for
					the production of large-scale opto-mechanical microsystems in glass. The goal of the project was to
					implement
					flexible guidings to minimize energy losses caused by system friction. I utilized Matlab for
					calculations and
					optimizations, as well as Fusion CAD software for 3D printing and generating the mechanism's
					designs.
					The primary objective was to develop a dynamically balanced two-degree-of-freedom (roll and pitch)
					mechanism
					capable of rotating at frequencies up to 820 Hz. We successfully fulfilled all the specifications
					outlined in
					the project requirements.</p>

					lock
					in fully inserted and fully removed positions. We began with a meticulous design phase, calculating
					dimensions for the actuator, restoring mechanism, and locking mechanism. Simulations using COMSOL
